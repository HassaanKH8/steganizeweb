# Steganize - Hide Text in Image and Decode Text in Image ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

This is a simple web application that allows users to encode and decode hidden text messages within images. The app leverages **Steganography** â€“ a technique for concealing information in digital media â€“ to securely embed secret messages in images.

## âœ… Features

- **Encode Text into an Image**: Users can input a secret text message, which will be encoded and hidden inside an image.
- **Decode Text from an Image**: Users can upload an image that contains a hidden message and decode the text.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple, intuitive interface to make encoding and decoding seamless.

## How It Works

1. **Encoding**: 
   - Users select an image and provide the secret text message they wish to hide.
   - The app encodes the text into the image using Steganography techniques, and a new image with the hidden text is generated.
   
2. **Decoding**:
   - To reveal the hidden message, users can upload the image that contains the secret text.
   - The app extracts the hidden message from the image and displays it.
